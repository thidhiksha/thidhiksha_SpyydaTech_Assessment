**How to run the program** 
  -Make sure Python 3 is installed on the system. 
  -Open terminal/command prompt in the project folder and run: 
    -bash 
    -python word_frequency_counter.py
    -python balanced_brackets.py 
    -python caculator_with_history.py 
    -python library_management_system.py 
    -python longest_increasing_subsequence.py 
    -python url_shortner.py

#word frequency counter
  -The Word Frequency Counter program is used to count how many times each word appears in a paragraph. First, the text is converted into lowercase so that words like “Hello” and “hello” are treated as the same. Then, punctuation marks like commas and full stops are removed. After that, the text is split into individual words. A dictionary is used to store the words and their counts. Finally, the words are sorted by their frequency and printed from the highest count to the lowest count.

#Balanced brackets validator
  -The Balanced Brackets validator program checks whether the brackets in a given string are correct. It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets. When an opening bracket like “(“, “{“, or “[“ is found, it is added to the stack. When a closing bracket is found, the program checks if it matches the last opening bracket in the stack. If there is a mismatch or the stack is empty, the string is not balanced. If the stack is empty at the end, the brackets are considered balanced.

#Library management system
  -The Library Management System is a simple console-based program that helps manage books. It uses a dictionary to store book names and their status, such as “Available” or “Borrowed”. The user is given a menu to choose actions like adding a book, searching for a book, borrowing a book, and returning a book. This program shows how real-world problems can be solved using basic programming logic.

#Longest Increasing Susequence
  -The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) program finds the length of the longest sequence of numbers that appear in increasing order. It uses a technique called dynamic programming. An extra list is created to store the length of the increasing sequence at each position. The program compares each number with the previous ones and updates the list. At the end, the highest value in the list is printed as the final result.

#url shortner
  -The URL Shortener program creates a short code for a long URL. It randomly generates a 6-character code using letters and numbers. This code and the original URL are stored in a dictionary. When the user enters the short code, the program returns the original URL. This program shows how online services like URL shorteners work in a basic way.

#Calculator with history
  -The Calculator with History program performs normal arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each result is saved in a list as a history record. The user can view the history to see all previous calculations. This program helps in understanding how data can be stored and reused during a program’s execution.
